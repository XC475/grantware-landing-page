        "How Does GrantWare AI Determine Grant Eligibility For My Organization?",
      answer:
        "GrantWare AI analyzes your organization profile‚Äîsuch as demographics, mission, budget, service area, performance metrics, and program priorities‚Äîagainst grant requirements and provides a 0‚Äì100 match score with a detailed rationale explaining exactly why a grant is or isn't a good fit for your organization.",

      question: "Can I upload my organization's existing grant data?",
      answer:

      question: "What Types Of Grants Does The Platform Cover?",

      question: "How Much Time Can We Realistically Save With GrantWare AI?",
      answer:
        "Teams should expect to see 50‚Äì70% time reduction across search, writing, and management. What once took weeks of hunting across sites now takes minutes with unified discovery. The AI eligibility analysis eliminates the need to manually parse dense RFPs just to discover you're not eligible. For writing, guided drafting produces a ready-to-edit proposal mapped to the RFP. For management, auto-generated timelines, tasks, and reminders keep work on track without bouncing between tools.",
    },

    },
    {
      question: "Can Multiple Team Members Collaborate On Grant Proposals?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Our platform offers all the collaboration features you'd expect from Word or Google Docs ‚Äî real-time editing, comments, track changes, and version control ‚Äî but with AI that helps draft, edit, and organize your proposals automatically. Team members can work together seamlessly while maintaining permissions, review workflows, and approval processes.",
